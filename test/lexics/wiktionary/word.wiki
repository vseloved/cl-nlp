=====Usage notes=====
* {{sense|distinct unit of language}} In English and other space-delimited languages, it is customary to treat "word" as referring to any sequence of characters delimited by spaces. However, this is not applicable to languages such as [[Chinese]] and [[Japanese]], which are normally written without spaces, or to languages such as [[Vietnamese]], which are written with a space between each [[syllable]].

{{wikipedia|word (computing)}}
* {{sense|computing}} The size (length) of a word, while being fixed in a particular machine or processor family design, can be different in different designs, for many reasons. See {{w|Word (computing)}} for a full [[explanation]].

=====Quotations=====
* '''1897''', Ouida, ''The New Woman'', in ''An Altruist and Four Essays'', page 239:
*: But every '''word''', whether written or spoken, which urges the woman to antagonism against the man, every '''word''' which is written or spoken to try and make of her a hybrid, self-contained opponent of men, makes a rift in the lute to which the world looks for its sweetest music.
* '''2011''', John Lehew (senior), ''The Encouragement of Peter'' (ISBN 1615074708), page 108:
*: In what sense is God's Word living? No other '''word''', whether written or spoken, has the power that the Bible has to change lives.
