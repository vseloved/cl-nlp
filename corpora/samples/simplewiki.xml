'''April''' is the fourth [[month]] of the [[year]], and comes between [[March]] and [[May]]. It has 30 [[day]]s. April begins on the same day of week as [[July]] in all years and also [[January]] in leap years.

April's [[flower]]s are the [[Sweet Pea]] and [[Asteraceae|Daisy]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[diamond]]. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.

== The Month ==

April comes between [[March]] and [[May]], making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as [[June]], [[September]] and [[November]] are later in the year. It starts on the same day of the week as [[July]] every year, and starts on the same day as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. In a [[common year]], April starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the previous year, and in [[leap year]]s starts on the same day as [[May]] of the previous year.
April ends on the same day of the week as [[December]] every year. In a [[common year]], it ends on the same day as [[July]] of the previous year. In a [[leap year]], it ends on the same day as [[October]] of the previous year.

April is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn|autumn/fall]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[October]] in the other.

It is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the [[Latin]] word &quot;aperire&quot;, meaning &quot;to open&quot;, referring to [[flower]]s opening in [[spring]]. Another theory is that the name could come from [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of [[love]]. It was originally the second month in the old Roman [[Calendar]], before the start of the new year was put to [[January 1]].

Quite a few festivals are held in this month. In many [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures, new year is celebrated in this month. In Western [[Christianity]], [[Easter]] can be celebrated on a [[Sunday]] between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]]. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christianity, it can fall between [[April 4]] and [[May 8]]. At the end of the month, Central and Northern [[Europe]]an [[culture]]s celebrate [[Walpurgis Night]] on [[April 30]], marking the transition from [[winter]] into [[summer]].

== April in poetry ==
[[poetry|Poets]] use ''April'' to mean the end of winter. For example: ''April showers bring [[May]] flowers.''
